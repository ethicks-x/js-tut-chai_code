# Javascript Tutorial Repo (Notes)
This is a repo just to store the notes of my current learning journey of JS. Maybe I would never look back into it......Who knows?

## Development container
So I'm using a development container for a better experience which I don't know even make sense but yk it's quite fun doing.

download the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml file to start up the environment I'm using.
```
docker compose build && docker compose up
```
